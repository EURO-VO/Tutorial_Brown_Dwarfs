# Tutorial: Brown Dwarfs

## Technical Notes
This repository contains the Latex source files and compiled pdf of the Brown Dwarfs EURO-VO tutorial (http://www.euro-vo.org/sites/default/files/documents/tutorial-brown-dwarfs_2019Dec.pdf). 

To compile the Latex source you will need the style file and the images from the template and image repository (https://github.com/EURO-VO/Tutorials_ESCAPE_templates_Images)

## Summary of the Tutorial
In this use case, we explore different ways to do the same tasks with different
VO tools. These tasks include:
 - obtaining data from the SDSS and 2MASS catalogues in a given sky region,
 - crossmatching the results of these searches,
 - filtering the resulting table for brown dwarfs, and
 - verifying our sample of brown dwarfs.
 
Software packages needed for this tutorial are Aladin, TOPCAT and STILTS.
